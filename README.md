## Deployment on IIS

1. Configure **Flask App** behind IIS as a FastCGI Application:
    - Use **Waitress** as the WSGI server.
    - Create a site binding on IIS pointing to your Flask app.
    - Forward requests to `localhost:5000`.

2. Setup Firewall Rules:
    - Open port `5000` to allow communication with the Flask backend.

## Data Persistence

- The application uses a `games.json` file to store all active game data:
    - Games
    - Teams
    - Scores
    - Match results
- The file is updated dynamically whenever changes are made in the control or scoreboard pages.

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for multiplayer over WebSockets.
- Implement user authentication for better game management.
- Extend support for additional game types or custom rules.
